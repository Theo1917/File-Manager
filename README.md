# File-Manager
File Manager in C This file management system in C is implemented to allow users to perform basic file operations like creating, deleting, renaming, and moving files. The system also provides users with the ability to browse through directoriesand view file details as well as search for files using C's file handling and its system-level programming.
File Operation:
Lets users create, delete, rename, and move files and directories.
Directory Navigation: Browse and list files in directories, showing file properties (size, date, etc).
File Search: Search for files according to name, type, or date.
File Sorting: Sorts files according to name, size, or modification date.
CLI-based User Interface: Command-line interface for easy user interaction.
Error Handling: Implements basic error checking for invalid operations such as deleting non-existent files or accessing the restricted directory.
Technologies Used:
C (for core programming)
File I/O (using fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, etc.)
POSIX/Unix system calls (opendir, readdir, closedir, etc.)
Directory and file manipulation using C libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, dirent.h, sys/stat.h)
This project demonstrates how to build a file manager using C, focusing on efficient file system operations and basic error handling to create a smooth user experience.
